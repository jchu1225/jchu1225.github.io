When properly designed, experiments enable unbiased estimation of causal effects in a sample. The goal of this course is to introduce you to the logic and practice of experiments. This course has two parts. The first part is an introduction to experiments and their assumptions. You will build upon this knowledge in the second part of the course to design an experiment on a topic of your choice.\nWhy learn experimental methods for social research?\nExperimental design is a useful framework for thinking through social scientific problems. You will learn how to conduct your own experiment, identify its strengths and weaknesses, and analyze results thoughtfully. These skills train you to formalize what you are trying to identify (estimand) and how you plan to do so. These skills will assist in helping you think more clearly about social scientific problems more generally.\nExperiments are often deployed across the social sciences. You will learn how to read, understand, and critique experiments. You will also learn the limitations of experimental research, to better motivate other methodological choices.\nExperimental methods are a foundation for learning other causal inference methods. We will not be covering quasi-experimental designs or other methods of causal inference in this course, but a firm grasp of experimental methods is often necessary to understand them.\nWhat will you be able to know and do by the end of the course?\nIdentify the logic of causality assumed in experiments. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of experimental research. Diagnose and address threats to internal validity in experiments. Analyze the results of an experiment. Recognize the limitations of experiments and be able to thoughtfully critique them. Design an experiment that you could submit for funding and implement. What kind of student does this course have in mind?\nThis course is limited to doctoral students in Sociology and related disciplines. I will assume that you have taken at least an introductory statistics course (through linear regression). For a refresher, you may be interested in the following books:\nüìï Angrist, Joshua, and Steffan Jorg Pischke. 2009. Mostly Harmless Econometrics. Princeton: Princeton University Press.\nüìï Morgan, Stephen L., and Christopher Winship. 2014. Counterfactuals and Causal Inference: Methods and Principles for Social Research, Second Edition. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.\nHow will performance be assessed?\nAssignment Description Deadlines Short writing assignments (30%) There are seven short assignments that build toward the final experiment proposal. Details about the assignments are provided along with the readings below. Assignments are graded for completeness. Due throughout the semester via upload to Canvas by 11:59 pm the day before our class meets. Analysis paper (10%) Based on data from an experiment, I will ask you to answer a specific set of questions. More details will be provided in class. Due via upload to Canvas the day before class meets on April 4. Experiment proposal (40%) The final assignment of the course is to develop a proposal for an experiment, ideally one that can be submitted for funding. If you are proposing a survey experiment, I expect final assignments to be modelled after a TESS proposal ( http://tessexperiments.org/). For other types of experiments, you should submit a pre-analysis plan or pre-registration, e.g. Open Science Framework. If other formats are preferred, let me know by email as soon as possible. Due via upload to Canvas by 11:59pm on Sunday May 5. In class participation (20%) A key component of this seminar will be in-class student participation. Participation refers to informed contributions to the class. You should be ready to discuss your short assignments in class. In addition, you will be asked to prepare a final presentation of your experimental proposal. Please submit all assignments in 12-point type size, double-spaced, with one-inch margins. These are disciplinary standards and using double-space allows me to give better feedback. All assignments should be uploaded to Canvas.\nWhat are the basic norms in this course?\nIf you need disability-related accommodations, let me know as soon as possible. You have the right to have your needs met. If you need accommodations, you should be registered with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) in 008 Milbank (212-854-2388, disability@columbia.edu). Life happens. If you submit your work after the deadlines listed above, you will still qualify for half of the original points. Avoid using cell phones in class, which can prevent you or others from learning. In cases of emergencies, please take your phone outside. I try to respond to emails within 24 hours. You are welcome to follow-up if I have not responded by then. What are expectations regarding academic integrity?\nGraduate students are expected to exhibit the highest level of personal and academic honesty as they engage in scholarly discourse and research. In practical terms, you must be responsible for the full and accurate attribution of the ideas of others in all of your research papers and projects; you must be honest when taking your examinations; you must always submit your own work and not that of another student, scholar, or internet source. Graduate students are responsible for knowing and correctly utilizing bibliographical guidelines.\nWhere can I access course materials?\nThe readings for each week of this course are listed below. There is one required textbook for this course:\nüìï Gerber, Alan S., and Donald P. Green. 2012. Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation. New York: W.W. Norton.\nOther than the required textbook, all other readings are available online via the below links.

Who gets respect? On what basis? Differences in respect and esteem are a basic form of inequality, with consequences for the (re)production of other inequalities and their durability. The goal of this course is to equip you to see the throughline between status, evaluation, and inequality. Along the way, you will learn how social psychological theories at the micro-level relate to macro-level inequalities. We will tackle questions like the following: Why, and how, do status hierarchies emerge in nearly all societies and groups? How do status differences affect material inequalities like access to jobs? Why is it so hard to change inaccurate stereotypes about women or racial minorities?\nWhat is the structure of course sessions? This is a survey course. Each week we will discuss key readings on a topic. Class will meet once per week and requires participation.\nThis seminar is designed to generate new research ideas. To do so, the course will push you to understand key ideas in an expansive literature, and you will be asked to submit short papers that meaningfully extend the ideas in the readings.\nYou may choose to write an empirical or conceptual paper. For an empirical paper, you should outline an original empirical study somehow informed by or related to the week‚Äôs readings. Your summary should be organized in the following four sections: (1) a research question (1-2 sentences), (2) a description of methods (2-3 paragraphs), (3) your prediction(s) (1-2 sentences), and (4) why the study would be interesting and/or important (2-3 sentences).\nFor a conceptual paper, you should advance one or more of the week‚Äôs readings in some way. Examples include: (a) connnecting ideas from two or more papers to develop a more general theory; critiquing ideas in one or more papers and proposing an alternative that you argue is better or more valid; developing a rival theory to challenge the ideas in one or more papers. In your conceptual paper, underline your main thesis statement(s) (1-2 sentences).\nWhat kind of student does this course have in mind? This is a graduate survey course that is also open to advanced undergraduate students in Sociology and related disciplines. There are no formal pre-requisites.\nHow will performance be assessed? There are four requirements for this class.\nAssignment Description Deadlines Short papers (30%) Choose any four (4) weeks to submit either an empirical or conceptual short paper. You may submit more than four, and the best four will constitute your final grade Due throughout the semester via upload to Coursework by 11:59pm the day before class. Final paper (30%) This class does not have a conventional final paper. Rather, the final paper is an opportunity for you to further develop your research creativity. The final paper will consist of 3 short papers. Let me know if an alternative format would be preferred (e.g. draft research proposal, draft paper). The final paper is due via upload to Coursework by 11:59pm on Dec 11. You are welcome to submit these in advance. Leading discussion (10%) On the second week of class, please sign up to be discussion leaders for one of the weeks. As a discussion leader, you will communicate to the class what you see as the most important points raised by the readings and prompt additional discussion about them. Class participation (30%) Participation refers to informed contributions to the class. Contributions should be linked to what others have said or concretely to something in the readings. In addition to in-class participation, select readings will be included on Perusall to help us collectively engage with the readings. Perusall is like Google Docs for the readings: you can highlight, comment, discuss, tag, and otherwise share your questions or observations about each text. Some people will contribute more in class, others will contribute more through online comments. Both are valid forms of participation. What are the basic norms in this course? If you need disability-related accommodations, let me know as soon as possible. You have the right to have your needs met. If you need accommodations, you should be registered with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) in 008 Milbank (212-854-2388, disability@columbia.edu). Life happens. If you submit your work after the deadlines listed above and before the final class of the semester, you can still receive up to 90% of the original points. (But, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to receive comments.) Avoid using cell phones in class, which can prevent you or others from learning. In cases of emergencies, please take your phone outside. I try to respond to emails within 24 hours. You are welcome to follow-up if I have not responded by then. What are expectations regarding academic integrity? Students are expected to exhibit the highest level of personal and academic honesty as they engage in scholarly discourse and research. In practical terms, you must be responsible for the full and accurate attribution of the ideas of others in all of your research papers and projects.\nWhere can I access course materials? The readings for each week of this course are listed below and can be accessed by the links. For longer or more methodologically complex research papers, reading notes will be provided on Perusall. You are not expected to read and understand all elements.\nThe following are books you might want to own, and which we will read substantial portions from.

Social networks are integral in everyday life. Networks are part of how we get a job, find partners, and discover new music. They also help us explain cultural change, innovation, or pandemic dynamics.\nThe goal of the course is equip you to think sociologically1 about networks. A unifying theme is that the social world is relational. How would we identify whether someone is respected in a group, except in relation to others in the group? How do we identify whether something is innovative without relating it to what came before? Often, we can better understand the social world when we think through the lens of social networks.\nDuring the first four weeks of this course, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn the basic vocabulary around networks and network analysis. The remaining weeks will explore topics like social capital, innovation, hierarchy, power, homophily, contagion, culture, and peer influence. Theory and methods are intertwined, and the course will require that you collect, visualize, and analyze a social network. In groups, you will produce a final paper that uses concepts from this course to describe what you see in the network you collect.\nWhat should you expect to get out of this course? By the end of the course, you should be able to:\nidentify social networks in everyday life, analyze the building blocks of networks, such as dyads and triads, collect your own network data on a problem interesting to you, describe the features of the network you collected, articulate how social networks help us understand important social phenomena. What is the structure of course sessions? Class will meet once per week. Each class typically will begin with discussion of readings which requires participation. I will conclude class with a 20 minute lecture to highlight key concepts and notations that will assist you in the following week\u0026rsquo;s readings.\nA core part of this class is group discussion and collaboration. Working collaboratively is a core skill that you will use in nearly any career you choose. Also, after a year of remote learning, working in groups is a way to reconnect with or meet new people.\nWhat kind of student does this course have in mind? This is an undergraduate upper division seminar. That means it is intended for advanced undergraduate students in Sociology and related disciplines. There are no formal pre-requisite courses, and I have designed the course to be accessible even to those with no programming experience. We will not be covering statistical modelling of networks (such as exponential random graph models), and as such, this course will complement methods-focused courses like \u0026ldquo;GR 5062 Social Network Analysis.\u0026rdquo;\nHow will performance be assessed? There are four requirements for this class.\nAssignment Description Deadlines Final project (30%) You will collect your own social network data to write a short paper (max 20 pages, double spaced). This report should (a) describe your data collection, (b) visualize your network, (c) summarize the concepts and ideas you are investigating, and (d) showcase what you see in your network. This will be a group project with 2-3 people. To reduce the chance of unfair work distribution, please submit your final paper in the form of a Google doc. I will rely on document history to see who contributed what. I may also ask your group for a contribution statement. A rubric will be provided in class. Your group will present your project results on April 28. The final paper is due via upload to Coursework by 11:59pm on Wednesday May 4. Short assignments (15%) There are five short assignments due earlier in the semester. These are meant to jumpstart your progress toward the final project. Due throughout the semester via upload to Coursework by 5:00 pm Wednesday, the day before the class. Leading discussion and memos (25%) Please sign up to be discussion leaders for one of the weekly readings. You will do this twice (2x) during the semester. As a discussion leader, you will communicate to the class what you see as the most important points raised by the readings and prompt additional discussion about them. Discussion leaders should also write a 1-page single spaced memo that summarizes (1 paragraph), evaluates (1 paragraph), and extends (1-2 paragraphs) the core idea of a reading that interests you. Discussion leaders for that week are also invited to meet with me as needed. Please fill out a survey by 5:00pm Jan 21, ranking up to four papers you would be interested in leading. Class participation (30%) Participation refers to informed contributions to the class. In addition to in-class participation, we will be using Perusall to help us collectively engage with the readings. Perusall is like Google Docs for the readings: you can highlight, comment, discuss, tag, and otherwise share your questions or observations about each text. Some people will contribute more in class, others will contribute more through online comments. Both are valid forms of participation. What are the basic norms in this course? If you need disability-related accommodations, let me know as soon as possible. You have the right to have your needs met. If you need accommodations, you should be registered with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) in 008 Milbank (212-854-2388, disability@columbia.edu). Life happens. If you submit your work after the deadlines listed above and before the final class of the semester, you can still receive up to 90% of the original points. (But, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to receive comments.) Avoid using cell phones in class, which can prevent you or others from learning. In cases of emergencies, please take your phone outside. I try to respond to emails within 24 hours. You are welcome to follow-up if I have not responded by then. What are expectations regarding academic integrity? Students are expected to exhibit the highest level of personal and academic honesty as they engage in scholarly discourse and research. In practical terms, you must be responsible for the full and accurate attribution of the ideas of others in all of your research papers and projects; you must be honest when taking your examinations; you must always submit your own work and not that of another student, scholar, or internet source. Students are responsible for knowing and correctly utilizing bibliographical guidelines.\nWhere can I access course materials? The readings for each week of this course are listed below.
